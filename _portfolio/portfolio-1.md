**PREDICTIVE MAINTAINANCE**

* **Objective** : Before a equipment is going to fail we need to predict the survival gap of the equipment.
* **Approach** : To model this problem we collected 10lakh rows, analyzed them to understand failure rate of each and every individual equipment. We modeled Failure rate of the equipment based on other parameters and researched which are the right indicator to predict the survival gap. We future engineered and picked up the best features based on decision tree. Built this model on top Random Forest Algorithm with an accuracy 98%.
* **Analysis** : EDA, Statistical testing, Feature selection, Classification(Random Forest/XGBoost/Logistic Regression/Decision Tree).
* **Model validation** : Confusion Matrix, Classification Report (F1 Score), Accuracy Score.
* **Key Skills** : Python, SQL, Predictive Modeling, Machine learning, Data Mining, Time Series Analysis, IoT & Sensor Data, Big Data Technologies, Data Visualization, Domain Expertise.
